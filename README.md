Program Glossory:
course folder: contain course class, and function related to its database
teacher folder: contain teacher class, and function related to its database
potential_useless_file: may not be of use due to use of "class"
schedule: schedule class with its ability to generate its own schedule and calculate hard constraints

progress:
able to generate initial schedule and check for its hard constraints
next step: will implement genetic algorithm (basic version) in the algorithm portion





What is this project for: 
K-12 principles can use this program to create their master's schedule for the school year. 
It is a work in progress.

Assumption for input: 
Teacher name needs to be unique


Need to update: 
The function to calculate the number of hard constraints can use an easier function, 
where it extracts the teacher/class information, put in a list, 
Then check if the list has any repeating iteams. --> could be easier or harder...
