What is this project for: 
K-12 principles can use this program to create their master's schedule for the school year. 
It is a work in progress.

Assumption for input: 
Teacher name needs to be unique


Need to update: 
The function to calculate the number of hard constraints can use an easier function, 
where it extracts the teacher/class information, put in a list, 
Then check if the list has any repeating iteams. --> could be easier or harder...
